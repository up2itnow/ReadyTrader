## 🛠️ Configuration Instructions

### 1. Free RSS News & Fear/Greed
These work **out-of-the-box** with zero configuration. AI agents will automatically fallback to these if no paid keys are found.

### 2. CryptoPanic (Highly Recommended)
CryptoPanic is the gold standard for aggregated crypto news.
1.  Sign up at [CryptoPanic Developers](https://cryptopanic.com/developers/api/).
2.  Copy your **API Token**.
3.  Add it to your `.env`:
    ```bash
    CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY=your_token_here
    ```

### 3. X / Twitter (Social Volume)
To see what people are saying about a specific token ($BTC, $SOL):
1.  Sign up for a Developer Account at [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/).
2.  Create a **Project** and an **App**.
3.  Generate an **App-only Bearer Token**.
4.  Add it to your `.env`:
    ```bash
    TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token_here
    ```

### 4. Reddit Sentiment
Great for detecting "FOMO" or "FUD" in `/r/cryptocurrency`.
1.  Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).
2.  Click "Create another app..." at the bottom.
3.  Select **script**. Name it "ReadyTraderAgent".
4.  Redirect URI can be `http://localhost:8080`.
5.  Save and copy your **Client ID** (under the name) and **Client Secret**.
6.  Add them to your `.env`:
    ```bash
    REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    ```

### 5. NewsAPI (Institutional News)
For high-signal news from major financial outlets.
1.  Get a key at [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/).
2.  Add it to your `.env`:
    ```bash
    NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
    ```

## 🤖 Agent Tool Reference

AI Agents can query these feeds using the following tools:

- `get_free_news(symbol="")`: Aggregates RSS feeds. Best for overall context.
- `get_sentiment()`: Returns the Fear & Greed Index.
- `get_social_sentiment(symbol)`: Queries X and Reddit.
- `get_financial_news(symbol)`: Queries NewsAPI.
- `get_news()`: Queries CryptoPanic.

> [!TIP]
> When multiple keys are missing, the system will provide a **Simulated Score** but also include instructions on which keys are needed. This allows for rapid prototyping without immediate expense.
